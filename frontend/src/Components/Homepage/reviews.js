They source the deprived kids, make them realise the value of Education, and educate them. Apart from education, the organization also focuses on activities which lead to overall development of kids. Having witnessed the activities of Edignite volunteers, I really appreciate the efforts they put in the education of kids. I am heartly touched by their service and like the way they fulfill their duty to the society."

The thing I like about Edignite volunteers is that they are students who are hustling in their lives too. Still the take out some hours from their valuable time and teach these kids. As it is rightly said, charity of knowledge is the greatest charity, I salute the Edignite team for their charity of knowledge"
